# GameReviewPreventing

Before you become vested in a Game, what if you could find out how popular it really is? 
What if it was rated to help you learn how fun it really is?
this  database of 80,000 board games includes information such as minimum players, 
maximum players, minimum playtime, maximum playtime, etc. I use the models to ensure 
that using all of this information, it gives an accurate prediction regarding the reviews.
